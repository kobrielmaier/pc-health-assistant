## Marketing Copy Analysis

### Before (Implied):
"Click a problem type to diagnose"

### After (Explicit):
**For AI Assistant:**
- "Have a specific issue?" (Acknowledges user need)
- "Chat with our AI assistant" (Clear action)
- "Perfect for describing exact problems..." (Use case example)
- "NVIDIA driver crashes when playing games" (Concrete example)

**For Quick Scans:**
- "Not sure what's wrong?" (Acknowledges uncertainty)
- "Choose a common problem" (Simple action)
- "Let AI investigate everything" (Benefit)

## Messaging Strategy

### AI Assistant Section:
✅ **Positions as:** Premium, intelligent, targeted
✅ **For users who:** Know their specific issue or want verification
✅ **Key benefit:** "Investigates your specific issue"

### Quick Scans Section:
✅ **Positions as:** Easy, comprehensive, no-knowledge-needed
✅ **For users who:** Don't know what's wrong
✅ **Key benefit:** "Let AI investigate everything"

## A/B Testing Hypothesis

**Hypothesis:** Featuring the AI Assistant prominently will:
1. **Increase engagement** with conversational diagnostic
2. **Reduce support requests** ("how do I describe my problem?")
3. **Improve user satisfaction** (targeted help vs. broad scans)
4. **Showcase app's intelligence** (Claude-powered)

**Metrics to track:**
- % of users clicking AI Assistant vs. Quick Scans
- Average resolution time (AI vs. Quick Scans)
- User satisfaction ratings
- Repeat usage rates

## Accessibility

### Screen Readers:
- Clear heading hierarchy (h2 for sections)
- Descriptive button text
- Alt text for icons (emojis have semantic meaning)

### Keyboard Navigation:
- All buttons keyboard-accessible
- Clear focus indicators
- Logical tab order

### Color Contrast:
- White text on purple gradient: WCAG AAA compliant
- CTA button: High contrast for visibility

## Technical Implementation

### Files Modified:
1. **App.jsx** (Lines 379-439)
   - Added AI Assistant featured section
   - Added event listener for CTA button
   - Added "OR" divider
   - Added section subtitle

2. **App.css** (Added ~180 lines)
   - `.ai-assistant-featured` - Main container
   - `.ai-assistant-cta` - Primary button
   - `.ai-features` - Feature grid
   - Animations (slideIn, float)
   - Responsive breakpoints

### Event System:
```javascript
// CTA button dispatches custom event
onClick={() => {
  const event = new CustomEvent('open-ai-assistant');
  window.dispatchEvent(event);
}}

// App component listens for event
useEffect(() => {
  const handleOpenAI = () => setCurrentView('conversational');
  window.addEventListener('open-ai-assistant', handleOpenAI);
  return () => window.removeEventListener('open-ai-assistant', handleOpenAI);
}, []);
```

## Success Criteria

## Conclusion

The new home page design:

2. ✅ **Explains what it's used for** (specific issues, verification)
3. ✅ **Shows how it investigates** (step-by-step, questions)
